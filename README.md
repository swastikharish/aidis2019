Code to read and analyse NSSO All India Debt and Investment Survey 2019 data. Some analyses have been built here - mostly focusing on land and housing in urban areas - other analyses can be programmed by modifying the code appropriately. The R file contains the code. The dict_test file contains the data dictionary for reading the NSSO files. The pdf (from NSSO) contains all the links to download the (.txt) data files.
